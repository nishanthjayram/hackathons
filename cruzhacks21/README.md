# Jojoba
A web browser extension designed to integrate with LinkedIn to store relevant information about job applications (may include other job sites in the future).

Planned functionality in the future includes: automating the job application organization process; sending email reminders about relevant and upcoming deadlines; suggesting similar jobs to apply to based on user's application history.
